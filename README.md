# Real-Time-ISS-Tracker-with-Astronaut-On-Board
Developed a real-time International Space Station (ISS) tracker in Python, integrating two APIs for location and astronaut data with graphical modules for live representation on a world map

This project visualizes the real-time position of the International Space Station using the `turtle` graphics library in Python.

## Features
- Fetches current astronauts aboard the ISS
- Displays ISS position on a world map (`turtle`)
- Saves astronaut names in `iss.txt`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- map.gif and iss.gif images in the same directory

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
